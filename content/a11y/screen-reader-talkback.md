> TalkBack is the Google screen reader included on Android devices. TalkBack gives you spoken feedback so that you can use your device without looking at the screen.

## Start TalkBack

To start TalkBack:

1. Go in your device settings
2. Open Advanced
3. Open Accessibility
4. Turn on TalkBack

I would recommend setting TalkBack as your **Accessibility shortcut**. Turn on **Accessibility shortcut** and select TalkBack as the shortcut service. The shortcut depends on your device.

## How to use TalkBack

TalkBack is a gesture-based screen reader. We are going to use our screen to navigate.

Here is a list of the default gesture for navigating:
