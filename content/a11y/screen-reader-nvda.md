NVDA is a free and open source screen reader, it can be download on the [NV access website](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)

Once installed if you have created a shortcut on your desktop, you can use `ctrl` + `alt` + `n` to launch NVDA. The Welcome dialogue will appear, I use the `CapsLock` key as the NVDA modifier key as I'm on a laptop, by default the `insert` key is set as the NVDA modifier key.
