## NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access) (Windows)

> NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.

NVDA is a free and open source software, it can be download on the [NV access website](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) 

Once install if you have created a shortcut on your desktop, you can use `ctrl` + `alt` + `n` to launch NVDA. The Welcome dialog will appear, I use the `CapsLock` key as the NVDA modifier key as I'm on a laptop, by default the `insert` key is set as the NVDA modifier key.
