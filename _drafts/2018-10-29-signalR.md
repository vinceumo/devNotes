SignalR is a ASP.NET library for real-time applications. It use the WebSockets API:

> The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
> [The WebSocket API (WebSockets) - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

SignalR comes pre instal with ASP.NET Core 2.1 . If you don't have .NET core SDK on your machine, you can instal this one from the [microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)


## Create a new .NET core MVC project

Create a new .NET core MVC project. 

If you are using the terminal run:

```bash
dotnet new mvc
```

## Set up our hub

First we need to create a hub. The hub is a class used for persistent connections between the client and the server.

At the root of our project lets create a `ChatHub.cs`:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace signalrChatApp
{
  public class ChatHub : Hub
  {
    public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
    {
      await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
    }
  }
}
```

In `Startup.cs`

```cs
//...
using signalrChatApp;

//...

namespace MyApp
{
  public class Startup
  {
    //...
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
      //...
      services.AddSignalR();
    }

    //...

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
      //...
      app.UseSignalR(routes =>
      {
        routes.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chatHub");
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## Set up our front end with vue.js

We are going to use the `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` file to make our demo, I got rid of all the unuse markup in this file and the `_lautout.cshtml` as well

## Add our dependencies

First we need the `@aspnet/signalr` package. You can download it from npm

```bash
npm install @aspnet/signalr
```

Copy the file in `node_modules/@sapnet/signalr/dist/browser/signalr.js` into the `wwwroot` folder.

Now we need the reference this file in our view

```html
<script src="~/signalr.js"></script>
```

We are going to add vue.js with a CDN as well:

```html
<!-- (Developer version) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

## Front End

Now that our dependencies have been added, let's work on the Front End.

Above our script let's add our app markup:

```html
<div id="chatApp"></div>
```
